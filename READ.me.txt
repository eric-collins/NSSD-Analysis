Welcome to the NSSD Analysis Github Repo. 

The process for conducting the analysis was

1.  Add all the NSSD podcasts available on Youtube to a playlist

2.  Use the tool found at www.williamsportwebdeveloper.com/FaxBackUp.aspx to compile a spreadsheet of Youtube URLs 

3.  Use Transcript Extraction.R to compile the transcripts for each URL in the spreadsheet

4.  Use NSSD Analysis to complile the data as necessary for particular visualizations.
